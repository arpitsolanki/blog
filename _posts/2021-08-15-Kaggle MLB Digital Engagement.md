## Background

This is my Kaggle notebook from the MLB Digital Engagement Competition that finished on Kaggle few days ago. The objective of the competition was to predict social media engagement for a MLB player. We had access to several datasets around player's demographics, their performances going back to past several years, team results, transfers etc.
