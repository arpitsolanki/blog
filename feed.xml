The objective of the competition was to predict social media engagement for a MLB player. We had access to several datasets around playerâ€™s demographics, their performances going back to past several years, team results, transfers etc.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Building a model to predict IPL match outcomes</title><link href="https://arpitsolanki.github.io/blog/2021/04/15/Building-a-model-to-predict-IPL-match-outcomes.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Building a model to predict IPL match outcomes" /><published>2021-04-15T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-04-15T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://arpitsolanki.github.io/blog/2021/04/15/Building-a-model-to-predict-IPL-match-outcomes</id><author><name></name></author><category term="python" /><category term="Streamlit" /><category term="IPL" /><summary type="html">App Link with final predictions - https://share.streamlit.io/arpitsolanki/ipl-prediction-engine/main/app.py</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Kaggle BCG - COVID-19 AI Challenge - First Prize Submission</title><link href="https://arpitsolanki.github.io/blog/2021/03/01/BCG-Covid19-AI-Challenge.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Kaggle BCG - COVID-19 AI Challenge - First Prize Submission" /><published>2021-03-01T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2021-03-01T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://arpitsolanki.github.io/blog/2021/03/01/BCG%20Covid19%20AI%20Challenge</id><author><name></name></author><category term="python" /><category term="Covid-19" /><category term="Plotly" /><summary type="html">Background 2020 was a difficult year for everyone around the world due to the Coronavirus pandemic. During the initial months of the pandemic we knew very little about the virus,how it spread and the potential treatments that could be used against it. We saw reports of medical infrastructure getting overburdened and high fatality rates across the globe due to lack of proper treatments for the virus. As time went on we kept learning more about the virus &amp;amp; the entire scientific &amp;amp; medical community got together to find ways of overcoming the virus. Among many things that came out, ones that I found particularly interesting were articles being published around negative correlation between BCG vaccination prevalence within a country &amp;amp; fatality rates from the virus. At the same time University of Ottawa &amp;amp; Estafet launched a hackathon on Kaggle to study this problem statement in more detail. The notebook below includes code for my submission for the hackathon, which won the first prize.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Using ML to win FPL</title><link href="https://arpitsolanki.github.io/blog/2021/02/06/Using-ML-to-win-FPL.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Using ML to win FPL" /><published>2021-02-06T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2021-02-06T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://arpitsolanki.github.io/blog/2021/02/06/Using-ML-to-win-FPL</id><author><name></name></author><category term="python" /><category term="FPL" /><summary type="html">Using ML to get better at FPL</summary></entry></feed>
